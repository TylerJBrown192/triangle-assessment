# Triangles

This is an app to find out if any 3 given lengths provide a triangle, and if so, what type of triangle it is. This app uses three input boxes, parses them into an array, and calls a lengthy javascript function with a math-based if/elseif statement.

## Instructions

This is a very basic app, all wrapped in bootstrap. All you have to do to get the information is type in three integers into the three separate boxes, and some text will pop up at the bottom letting you know the results!
